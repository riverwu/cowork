# Charcoal Minimal

Minimal, print-friendly theme — off-white canvas, near-black text, charcoal accents, single warm pop. No accent rules. Maximum restraint.

## When to use this theme
- Print-friendly hand-outs, minimalist consulting briefs, B&W-safe decks.

## When NOT to use
- Decks where you want a strong brand identity (this is intentionally muted).
